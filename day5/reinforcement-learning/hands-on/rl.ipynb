However, the training procedure is clearly not optimal: each policy in the search makes no use of observations and rewards seen by previous policies. For environments where it takes significant time and money to take actions and make observations (for example, a real robot picking strawberries), this is incredibly wasteful. In this section, we present a method that does take previous observations into account when learning.\n",
